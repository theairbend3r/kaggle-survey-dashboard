# Kaggle Survey 2019

This is a dashboard made using `R`, `Flexdashboard`, and the `Highcharter` library to analyze Kaggle’s user survey conducted in 2019.

In this dashboard, I’ve attempted to analyze 2 major themes —

* Women In STEM.
* R vs Python for data science.

I've written a [blog-post](https://towardsdatascience.com/kaggle-user-survey-2019-326e187ff207) where I analyse this data and report the key findings.
